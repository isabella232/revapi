= Building

Revapi is a mavenized project so to download it and build it you merely 
need to call

 git clone https://github.com/revapi/revapi.git
 cd revapi
 mvn install

== Building the site

[source,shell]
----
./etc/release/site.sh <list-of-modules>
----

This will build the site for all the modules specified + also for the modules that are dependent on the specified ones. The site will be pushed into a `staging` branch of the
site repository.

To make the site public, you additionally need to:

[source,shell]
----
cd revapi-site-assembly/build/site
git checkout master
git pull origin staging
git push
----

== Releasing

There is a release script that automatically releases all dependent modules along with
the modules specified.

[source,shell]
----
./etc/release/code.sh <list-of-modules>
----

where `<list-of-modules>` is a space-separated list of the names of the module directories.

This will deploy all the modules that were either specified on the command line or that
are dependent on the specified modules to Maven Central staging repository.

To finish the release, do the following:

. Go to https://oss.sonatype.org, log in and check that the artifacts are ready to be published.

. Release the artifacts from https://oss.sonatype.org.

. Many of the modules contain parts of the site specific to them. These are published as part of the release process
  automatically. To make the staged site changes public:
