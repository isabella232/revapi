The `revapi-java` extension released a couple of weeks ago contained a rather ugly regression that caused an index out
of bounds exception on interfaces that override methods from `java.lang.Object`.

This has now been fixed in the new `0.21.1` version of `revapi-java`. Please upgrade if you have been hit by this bug.
