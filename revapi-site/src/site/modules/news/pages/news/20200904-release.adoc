The most important feature of this release is the fix to a nasty stack overflow error while constructing
a textual representation of method signatures with intersection types in their type parameters (https://github.com/revapi/revapi/issues/211).

The other is a more strict handling of criticality configuration where the analysis will fail if it encounters an unknown criticality name (previously it would just print out a warning).

The following modules were released:

* revapi-basic-features:0.10.2
* revapi-java-spi:0.21.1
* revapi-ant-task:0.10.2
* revapi-java:0.22.1
* revapi-maven-plugin:0.12.2
* revapi-standalone:0.9.8
