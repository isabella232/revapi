Almost exactly one month after the last release, there comes another with 3 fixes:

https://github.com/revapi/revapi/issues/251[#251] - `protected` members of `final` classes are no longer
considered part of the API because they cannot be called by the "outside" code.

https://github.com/revapi/revapi/issues/250[#250] - the Revapi instance can now be shared by multiple threads and multiple analyses can run in parallel.

https://github.com/revapi/revapi/issues/253[#253] - an NPE caused by more strict handling of missing classes introduced in the last release is now fixed.

Thanks go out to https://github.com/konikvranik[Petr Vranik], https://github.com/uhafner[Ullrich Hafner] and https://github.com/chrisvest[Chris Vest] for reporting the bugs.
