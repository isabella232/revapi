= Fixed Regression 
:page-publish_date: 2020-08-01

There was a regression found that caused the `semver.ignore` extension to cause an infinite loop
when it found a problem breaking the semantic versioning constraints.

The new version of `revapi-basic-features`, `0.10.1`, fixes that problem. This new version is incorporated
in the newly released `revapi-maven-plugin` version `0.12.1`, `revapi-ant-task` version `0.10.1` and
`revapi-standalone` version `0.9.7`.

Thanks go out to https://github.com/brandstaetter[Hannes Brandstätter-Müller] for reporting the problem.
