Starting today there is an online tool for checking the difference between different versions of libraries on
https://diff.revapi.org.

For any artifact available in Maven Central, you can simply enter its coordinates and the versions that you want to
compare and you will get the summary of the API changes made between those versions. Because Java libraries don't
have clear API boundaries, you can filter out the non-interesting elements from the list.

Go ahead and https://diff.revapi.org[check it out]!

As everything in Revapi, the site is in beta, so your feedback, suggestions and bug reports are more than welcome!

NOTE: The tool is meant to aid in deciding whether it is safe to upgrade to a newer versions of some library. While it can
detect API changes, it cannot detect behavioral changes, so you should not base any decision solely on the output
of this tool.
