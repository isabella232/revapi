Shortly after releasing version 0.15.0, there is a new `revapi-java` extension release that fixes a regression which
caused inherited methods to seemingly break API in classes that were present in excluded archives (wow, a mouthful).

E.g. if you excluded certain archive from API check, the methods inherited from `java.lang.Object` and/or other
classes from archives that were not explicitly excluded were suddenly reported as breaking API.

This regression was serious enough to warrant a new release with just a fix to that single problem.
