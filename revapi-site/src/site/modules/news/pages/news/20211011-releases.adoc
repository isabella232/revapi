Another quick release with an important fix to missing type handling in `java-package` matcher, improved
handling of differences originating in dependencies in `revapi.versions` and a small new usability
improvement where each difference now can a documentation link where it is discussed in more detail. These links are now part of the output of the maven plugin.

The following bugs were fixed in this release: https://github.com/revapi/revapi/issues/249[#249], https://github.com/revapi/revapi/issues/244[#244] and https://github.com/revapi/revapi/issues/250[#250].
