During the discussion in https://github.com/revapi/revapi/issues/221 it has come to light that Revapi doesn't behave well when
there are some classes missing from the classpath (in that particular case, transitive provided dependencies) and Revapi is
configured to filter out these classes.

The new versions of the modules collectively fix the issue. `revapi-java-0.24.2` fixes the filtering of missing classes and 
`revapi-basic-features-0.12.2` doesn't choke on classes without an archive (which missing classes are).

`revapi-maven-plugin-0.14.3` includes the new fixed basic features.

Thanks go out to https://github.com/pzygielo[Piotrek Żygieło] for fixing wording in the warnings
in file-based reportersi (`revapi-reporter-file-base-0.4.2`, `revapi-reporter-json-0.4.2` and `revapi-reporter-text-0.14.2`) and in Revapi CLI (`revapi-standalone-0.11.2`).
