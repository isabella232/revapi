Revapi has started to use Java 9 for building while maintaining compatibility with Java 8 using the Animal Sniffer Maven
plugin. This has proven to be problematic and the link:20171015-releases.html[last] releases could not be used with
Java 8. This should be now fixed and compatibility with Java 8 restored.

The following were released:

* Revapi API 0.8.4
* Revapi Basic Features 0.6.3
* Revapi Ant Task 0.6.3
* Revapi Java SPI 0.14.0
* Revapi Java Extension 0.14.3
* Revapi Text Reporter 0.8.2
* Revapi Standalone 0.6.4
* Revapi Maven Plugin 0.9.4

In addition to the above fix, a new artifact is now released `revapi-java-test-support` starting at version `0.1.0`.
This artifact is supposed to help custom extensions with testing by providing simple utilities to build, compile and
inspect custom jar files.

Thanks go out to Petr Široký who found, diagnosed and fixed the compatibility issue. Petr, you're a star!
