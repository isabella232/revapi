Today, I've released new versions of all revapi components (required by an API change in the core revapi API). Also,
the Revapi site underwent a couple of changes worth mentioning.

I've implemented `osgi-revapi-extension` https://github.com/revapi/osgi-revapi-extension[module] that basically works as
a filter to only include classes exported from an OSGi bundle. If you're working with OSGi, give it a spin by adding it
as a dependency to the `revapi-maven-plugin`:

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.revapi</groupId>
    <artifactId>revapi-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>...</version>
    <configuration>
       ...
    </configuration>
    <dependencies>
       <dependency>
          <groupId>org.revapi</groupId>
          <artifactId>revapi-java</artifactId>
          <version>...</version>
       </dependency>
       <dependency>
          <groupId>org.revapi</groupId>
          <artifactId>osgi-revapi-extension</artifactId>
          <version>...</version>
       </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</plugin>
```

It is now possible to traverse the API even if there is no counterpart in the other API and run (some of) the checks
only on the classes of that API. This is useful for example for checking the non-public class usage when the very first
version of a library is being developed. This was reported as https://github.com/revapi/revapi/issues/109[#109].

In addition, the `java.class.nonPublicPartOfAPI` check can now be
https://revapi.org/modules/revapi-java/index.html#class_is_non_public_part_of_api[configured] to not report violations
that already exist in the prior version (while the default is still to report the violations even if they are already
present). This was reported as https://github.com/revapi/revapi/issues/108[#108].

The standalone CLI has been changed to only use JBoss Modules when establishing the classpath for the extensions which
should improve the reliability of it. Also, it can now report the possibility of errors when the extensions use
a different version of the core revapi API than the one bundled with the CLI. Overall, the CLI should now be more usable
and the problems with extensions more easily identifiable.

The `report-aggregate` goal no longer hardcodes some of the properties that are configurable in other goals. This was
reported as https://github.com/revapi/revapi/issues/105[#105].

The `revapi-java-test-support` which enables JUnit4 based tests to easily compile source code into jars and then
programmatically access the classes in those jars using `javax.lang.model` classes (as annotation processors do) has
been fixed to be actually useful.

The link:../https://revapi.org/modules/revapi-java/[Java Extension] navigation has been greatly simplified and all the
docs are now on a single page, making it hopefully easier to find stuff.

And last but not least, comments are now enabled on the news articles such as this as another communication channel you
can use to get in touch.

Thanks go out to Martin Monperrus for his work on making the site more usable, Ricardo Ferreira for fixing the
`report-aggregate` goal and to Matthew Kavanagh for reporting the problems with the `java.class.nonPublicPartOfAPI`
check. Your contributions are very much appreciated.
