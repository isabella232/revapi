This is possibly the biggest Revapi release in its 7 years history. Prominently, this release finally
introduces an almost all-powerful filtering of java elements using the
https://github.com/revapi/classif[Classif] library and thus closes one of the oldest open issues -
https://github.com/revapi/revapi/issues/17[#17] (almost exactly 5 years old).

But that is actually a smaller part of the release. The underlying extension schema validator has been ported from an
ancient tv4.js (executed using a script manager that is being phased out in Java) to the Java-based
https://github.com/networknt/json-schema-validator[JSON schema validator] which sped up the checks considerably. This
also prompted a move away from JBoss DMR for configuration representation and use of a more widespread library, Jackson.
The JBoss DMR based methods are still present to keep backwards compatibility for some time, but the move to Jackson is
highly encouraged in your custom extensions.

Also, the first non-java analyzers have been introduced. Having Jackson on the classpath implicitly prompted me to go
ahead and implement the xref:revapi-json::index.adoc[JSON] and xref:revapi-yaml::index.adoc[YAML] analyzers that are
able to detect additions, removals and changes in JSON and YAML files. That is not awfully useful in and of itself I
assume (although it could, depending on the usage), but these two are meant more as building blocks for more specialized
extensions tailored to specific configuration files for example.

The biggest part of the release though is a long overdue shake up of the analysis API itself. I have tried to minimize
the API breakage, but I was not completely successful and this release therefore is breaking both source and binary
compatibility with the previous versions of the API. As such, all extensions have to upgrade to the new API (which
shouldn't be too much work, but anyway). The extensions that come directly with Revapi are of course already upgraded.
I am sorry about the breakage, but I think the API has gotten to a much better state now, and I am quite happy with it.
We're getting close to 1.0.0 (I hope!) and so I want to make sure further changes won't be necessary after that for some
time.

In other words, if you plan to upgrade to the latest versions of Revapi components, please upgrade them all :) The new
Revapi API is at 0.13.0 and is used by the Maven plugin 0.13.0 and Revapi Java 0.23.0. Older releases of the extensions
are not compatible with the maven plugin 0.13.0.

There has also been a quite large update of the documentation which should reflect the additions of the advanced
matching, but most importantly contains a refreshed section on extending Revapi, complete with a set of examples now
included directly with the source code of Revapi itself (and part of the normal build, too, so that they are always
up-to-date).

So head over to xref:ROOT:downloads.adoc[] and check out all the new goodness (and please report any issues you
encounter :) ).
