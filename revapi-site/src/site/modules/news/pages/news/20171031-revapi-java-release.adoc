It was https://github.com/revapi/revapi/issues/101[discovered] that the analysis may fail if it encounters classes that
are missing from the dependency graph in certain situations. This should now be fixed and all users are encouraged to
upgrade to using `revapi-java-0.14.4` if possible.

Thanks go out to Martin Monperrus who discovered and helped analyze the issue.
