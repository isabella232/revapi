/**
 * The role of the jar extractor is to find class files in an archive that should be considered for API analysis.
 *
 * <p>
 * This is mainly meant for extracting the files from for example WAR files, etc, where the classes are nested within a
 * more complex directory structure.
 *
 * <p>
 * This interface is a normal Revapi extension that further extends {@code revapi-java}. As such it is also
 * configurable. The configuration can be placed under {@code revapi.java.extract} root using the extension id of the
 * implementation. E.g. in XML:
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * <revapi.java>
 *     <extract>
 *         <my.extractor.extension.id>
 *             ... config is here ...
 *         </my.extractor.extension.id>
 *     </extract>
 * </revapi.java>
 * }
 * </pre>

     * Tries to transform the data of the archive such that it looks like a simple jar file to the analyzer. This method
     * can be difficult to implement because needs to inspect the contents of the provided input stream and "rewrap" it
     * in a different way if needed.
     *
     * <p>
     * This method can theoretically base the transformation decisions on other metadata present on the provided archive
     * instance, but that is considered dangerous because it limits the reusability of the transformer between different
     * invocation types of Revapi (CLI vs Maven, etc, which may or may not use the same implementation of the archive).
     *
     * <p>
     * If the transformation is not possible the corresponding archive is supplied to the analysis in full.
     *
     * <p>
     * Note that the returned stream, if any, <b>MUST</b> be independent of the provided {@code archiveData}. This
     * method need not close the {@code archive}.
