= Class/Package Filtering

WARNING: This describes functionality that is superseded by xref:element-matching.adoc[].

Given Java's lacking modularity (prior to Java9), authors are often forced to make classes that are essentially an
implementation detail of a library public. Such classes are often included in packages like `impl` or `internal` to
hint at their non-public nature.

While Revapi offers the basic filtering capabilities using the
link:../../revapi-basic-features/extensions/filter.html[basic filter], it is often  simpler to exclude classes or
packages using this class / package filters specifically made for this
purpose (if for nothing else then for the simpler configuration).

By default, all classes are included. If the include filter is specified, only the classes matching the include
filter are included in the API check. The exclude filter can take out classes that would otherwise be included.

It is not possible include class that matches a class exclude filter (i.e. if include and exclude filter match the same
class, the class is not included) but it is possible to include an inner classes while its parent class is excluded.

It is not possible include classes in package that matches a package exclude filter (i.e. if include and exclude filter
match the same package, the classes are not included).

== Sample Configuration

```javascript
[
  {
    "extension": "revapi.java",
    "configuration": {
      "missing-classes": {
        "behavior": "report",
        "ignoreMissingAnnotations": false
      },
      "reportUsesFor": ["java.missing.newClass", "java.class.nonPublicPartOfAPI"],
      "filter": {
        "classes": {
          "regex": true,
          "include": ["com\\.acme\\.api\\..*"]
          "exclude": ["com\\.acme\\.api\\.WeRegretWePlacedThisInApi"]
        },
        "packages": {
          "regex": true,
          "include": ["com\\.acme\\.api\\..*"]
          "exclude": ["com\\.acme\\.internal"]
        }
      }
    }
  }
]
```

== Properties

`missing-classes.behavior`::
This tells the checker what to do when a class is found in the API that is not found in any of the provided jars. The
possible values are: `error`, `ignore` or `report` (the default). If `report` is chosen then the missing class is
reported as a problem with either `java.missing.oldClass` code or `java.missing.newClass` depending on whether the
class was found missing in the old or new version of the API.
`missing-classes.ignoreMissingAnnotations`::
If `true` (the default is `false`) the usage chain of annotation classes will not be tracked.
The end result of this is that annotation classes will not be considered part of the API and thus missing annotation
classes will not be reported.
`reportUsesFor`::
Revapi is able to track usage chains of the classes it finds in the API. For some (or all) problems you may want to know
how and where a certain class is used to be able to determine if that's something wrong or not. This configuration
property can either be a string `all-differences`, signifying that an example use chain will be reported for every found
difference or a list of difference codes for which the example use chain should be produced. By default the usage
chains are reported for the following problem codes: `java.missing.newClass`, `java.missing.oldClass`,
`java.class.nonPublicPartOfAPI`, `java.class.externalClassNoLongerExposedInAPI`, `java.class.externalClassExposedInAPI`.
`filter.classes.regex`::
Specifies whether to consider the strings in `exclude` and `include` lists as regular expressions or not. The default
value is `false`, meaning the strings are not considered as regular expressions.
`filter.classes.exclude`::
List of strings representing FQCNs or regular expressions matching FQCNs. Classes with the matching fully qualified
names (and the members of those classes) will be excluded from the API check.
`filter.classes.include`::
List of strings representing FQCNs or regular expressions matching FQCNs. Only classes with the matching fully qualified
names (and their members) will be included in the API check.
`filter.packages.regex`::
Specifies whether to consider the strings in `exclude` and `include` lists as regular expressions or not. The default
value is `false`, meaning the strings are not considered as regular expressions.
`filter.packages.exclude`::
List of strings representing full package names or regular expressions matching them. Classes with the matching package
names (and the members of those classes) will be excluded from the API check.
`filter.packages.include`::
List of strings representing full package names or regular expressions matching them. Classes with the matching package
names (and the members of those classes) will be included in the API check.

== Notes

Contrary to intuition, java packages are not hierarchical, even though they have hierarchical names. In Java parlance,
package `com.acme.foo` is a sub-package of `com.acme` but that does not mean that it's enclosing element is
`com.acme`. No, each package is a top level element that does not have any parent elements and which only contains
classes, not other packages.

Therefore if you want to exclude a package and all its sub-packages, you need to use a regular expression
`"com\\.acme(\\..+)?"` which will match the `com.acme` package and any of its sub-packages.
