/**
 * Heavily inspired by the equivalently named class in Clirr 0.6.
 *
 * <p>
 * This is an iterator that walks a pair of collections, returning matching pairs from the set.
 *
 * <p>
 * When an element is present in the left set but there is no equal object in the right set, the pair (leftobj, null) is
 * returned.
 *
 * <p>
 * When an element is present in the right set but there is no equal object in the left set, the pair (null, rightobj)
 * is returned.
 *
 * <p>
 * When an element in one set has an equal element in the other set, the pair (leftobj, rightobj) is returned.
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that the phrase "pair is returned" above actually means that the getLeft and getRight methods on the iterator
 * return those objects; the pair is "conceptual" rather than a physical Pair instance. This avoids instantiating an
 * object to represent the pair for each step of the iterator which would not be efficient.
 *
 * <p>
 * Note also that elements from the sets are always returned in the iteration order.
