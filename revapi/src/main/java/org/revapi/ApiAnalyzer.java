/**
 * An API analyzer is the main interface one has to implement to support checking some kind of API.
 *
 * <p>
 * The API analyzer is a kind of "hub" that, once configured, produces archive analyzers to crack open the API archives
 * and generate an element tree from them. Later on during the analysis the API analyzer is asked to create a difference
 * analyzer that will be responsible to check pairs of comparable elements, each coming from the different version of
 * the API.
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@link #close()} is not called if there is no prior call to {@link #initialize(AnalysisContext)}. Do all your
 * resource acquisition in initialize, not during the construction of the object.
 *
 * @param <E>
 *            the base type of elements analyzed by this analyzer
