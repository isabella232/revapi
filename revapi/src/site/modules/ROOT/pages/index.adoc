= Revapi API

This module contains the API of Revapi as well as the link:{attachmentsdir}/apidocs/org/revapi/Revapi.html[main class] that is used to
instantiate, configure and run the API analysis. It also contains a couple of simplistic implementations of the Revapi
interfaces to get you started with.

Probably more interesting than this short description is the xref:architecture.adoc[architecture] of
Revapi which explains the role of individual interfaces found in this module. Additionally you might wanna checkout the
link:{attachmentsdir}/project-reports.html[project reports] or link:{attachmentsdir}/apidocs[javadoc].

== Invocation

Revapi can be used in a couple of convenient ways - a xref:revapi-maven-plugin::index.adoc[maven plugin], a
xref:revapi-standalone::index.adoc[cli tool] or even an xref:revapi-ant-task::index.adoc[Ant task]. Please consult
the links for more details about those.

In here we're only going to deal with the invocation of the API analysis using the Java API when Revapi is used as a
library.

First of all, we need to determine what archives we are going to compare. For that Revapi uses the
link:{attachmentsdir}/apidocs/org/revapi/API.html[API] class:

```java
API oldApi = API.of(myArchiveV1).supportedBy(v1Dependencies).build();
API oldApi = API.of(myArchiveV2).supportedBy(v2Dependencies).build();
```

NOTE: The `myArchiveV1` and others in the example above are implementations of the
link:{attachmentsdir}/apidocs/org/revapi/Archive.html[archive interface]. Revapi API provides a single simple
implementation - link:{attachmentsdir}/apidocs/org/revapi/simple/FileArchive.html[FileArchive] which represents a file
as a Revapi archive - quite a useful and fitting thing. There are other implementations, too, though - for example
the maven plugin has an implementation of this, too, which wraps a maven archive in a revapi archive and provides
the maven archive's GAV as the revapi archive's name - quite a useful thing when reporting on what problems were found
in which archive.

== Configuration

Configuration is supplied using https://github.com/jbossas/jboss-dmr[JBoss DMR] which should in theory support
loading the configuration from various formats if enough effort is done on the user's side. Revapi as such has so far
been extensively tested only with JSON and XML data. Even if data was translated into DMR from another format than JSON,
the validation of that data will always be done against a JSON schema that is provided by the extensions.

For details, see the link:{attachmentsdir}/apidocs/org/revapi/AnalysisContext.html[AnalysisContext] class (and the way
it is supplied with configuration by the caller) and
link:{attachmentsdir}/apidocs/org/revapi/configuration/Configurable.html[Configurable] interface for what is required of
the extensions.

=== Pipeline Configuration

Since Revapi 0.11.0 (supported by Maven plugin 0.11.0, Ant Task 0.9.0 and CLI 0.9.0), Revapi can be configured to
include or exclude extensions even if they are available on the classpath. More importantly, the pipeline configuration
enables the users to group difference transforms into blocks using which one can overcome the transforms influencing
each other. For more details, see the xref:configuration.adoc[configuration] page.
