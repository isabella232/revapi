= Basic Extensions

There is a couple of basic extensions that are developed alongside the core Revapi library. These are by default
available when using the Revapi's maven plugin or using Revapi standalone. If you're using Revapi on your own, you need
to explicitly put the `revapi-basic-features-{page-component-version}.jar` on your class path, or depend on
`org.revapi:revapi-basic-features:{page-component-version}` maven artifact.
