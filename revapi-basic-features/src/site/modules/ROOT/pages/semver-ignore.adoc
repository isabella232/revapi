= Version-based Ignore Transformation

*Extension*: `revapi.semver.ignore`

WARNING: This extension is deprecated. Use the xref:versions.adoc[] extension instead.

Using this extension one can automatically ignore API changes that are allowed for a given version delta based on the
rules of semantic versioning (https://semver.org).

== Sample Configuration

```javascript
[
  {
    "extension": "revapi.semver.ignore",
    "configuration": {
      "enabled" : true,
      "versionIncreaseAllows" : {
        "major" : "breaking",
        "minor" : "nonBreaking",
        "patch" : "equivalent"
      },
      "passThroughDifferences": ["java.class.nonPublicPartOfAPI"]
    }
  }
]
```

```xml
<analysisConfiguration>
  <revapi.semver.ignore>
    <enabled>true</enabled>
    <versionIncreaseAllows>
      <major>breaking</major>
      <minor>nonBreaking</minor>
      <patch>equivalent</patch>
    </versionIncreaseAllows>
    <passThroughDifferences>
      <item>java.class.nonPublicPartOfAPI</item>
    </passThroughDifferences>
  </revapi.semver.ignore>
</analysisConfiguration>
```

== Properties

`enabled`::
If true, the transformation is in effect and ignores API differences according to the version delta. If false, which
is the default, the transformation does nothing.

`versionIncreaseAllows`::
Overrides the allowed severity of changes allowed at the certain version number increase. The defaults are based on the
semver versioning which allows breaking API changes on major release, non-breaking API changes on minor release and
no API changes on patch release or if the major version is `0`, breaking changes on minor release and non-breaking
changes on patch release.
+
The allowed properties in this map are: `major`, `minor` and `patch` indicating the component of the version string
being changed and the allowed values are `breaking`, `potentiallyBreaking`, `nonBreaking`, `equivalent` and `none`
indicating the severity of the API changes allowed for given version number change.
+
If some of the properties (`major`, `minor`, `patch`) are not specified, they assume the default values as outlined in
the above sample configuration.

`passThroughDifferences`::
A list of differences (empty by default) that should not be "silenced" by the semver ignore even if they should be
according to the semver rules. This can be used for differences that you really want to pay attention to regardless
of the version change.
+
NOTE: For example `java.class.nonPublicPartOfAPI` difference signifies a semantic error where you expose
a non-public class as part of your API. This means that the callers of your API won't be able to access the class or
pass it to the methods in the API that require it. This is a serious enough error that you usually don't want to
ignore it.

=== Implementation Note

This extension requires that the archives supplied to the analysis implement the
link:../../revapi/apidocs/org/revapi/Archive.Versioned.html[Archive.Versioned] interface. This is true for archives used
when analyzing using the Revapi maven plugin but if Revapi is used in the standalone mode or in some embedded situation
this might not be the case.

It is the responsibility of the caller of Revapi to supply the correct archive implementations, because Revapi in and
on itself doesn't know how to extract a version from an archive.

NOTE: It should be possible to implement a helper and/or a specialized archive decorating implementation that would
read the version from the jar manifest for example, but that work hasn't been done yet.
