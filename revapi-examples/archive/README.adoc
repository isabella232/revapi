= Archive Example

This is a very simple implementation of a file-based archive that also supplies a version of the archive.

Archives are not Revapi extensions as such, because they cannot be configured or otherwise managed by Revapi. They are
meant to be implemented by callers and supplied to Revapi analysis.
