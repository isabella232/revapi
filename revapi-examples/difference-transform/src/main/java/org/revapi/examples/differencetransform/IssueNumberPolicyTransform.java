/**
 * Once the API trees of the old and new APIs are established, they compared using a
 * {@link org.revapi.DifferenceAnalyzer}. The difference analyzer is obtained from the {@link org.revapi.ApiAnalyzer}.
 *
 * This difference analyzer produces an initial set of differences between elements that are specific to the type of API
 * the API analyzer checks.
 *
 * Each difference report from the initial set is processed by all transforms. Each transform is given a chance to
 * transform the differences from the original report and their intended changes are gathered. After the "round", the
 * changes are applied to the set of differences for the element pair and all the transforms can again react on the new
 * set of differences. This repeats until no further changes are made to the set by the transforms.
 *
 * You can spot in the explanation above that there is a good chance for an infinite loop if two or more transformers
 * form a "cycle", meaning that a difference that produced by one transformer is changed again into the original by a
 * second transformer, which again is transformed by the first transformer, etc.
 *
 * Revapi guards against this simply by doing at most 1{nbsp}000{nbsp}000 such iterations and then throwing an error.
 *
 * In addition to being asked to transform the found differences, the transforms are also informed about the progress of
 * the parallel traversal of the 2 API trees. This makes sure that the transforms can update their internal state during
 * the traversal without needing to again query (in some shape or form) the API tree for more information once asked to
 * perform the transformations.
 *
 * The {@link org.revapi.DifferenceAnalyzer} tries to explain the roles of the methods during the traversal and
 * transformation in detail.
 *
 * Let's try to implement a transform that will flag any difference that doesn't have an attachment called "issue-no"
 * with "error" criticality. Let's call it {@code IssueNumberPolicyTransform}. It is important for this transform to
 * only be called after the {@code revapi.differences} transformation. See the {@literal README.adoc} file that shows
 * how to do that.
